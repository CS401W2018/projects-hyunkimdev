    <h1>Engagement - OL, UL</h1>

    <h3>What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?</h3>
    <p>Think about html structure (tags) rather than how it looks like.</p>
    
    <h3>When is your project due?</h3>
    <p>Projects are due at midnight on Monday. But it's acceptable as long as you submit it before you go to bed (before 5am).</p>

    <h3>What are special entity characters?</h3>
    <p>&amp;amp;</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</h3>
