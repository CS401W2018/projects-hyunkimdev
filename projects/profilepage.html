    <p>I really enjoy watching <strong>good</strong> movies. I don't like watching any movies; it has to be a good movies. I tend to watch the same movie over and over. One of my favorite movie is <mark>"Contact" (1997)</mark>.</p>
    <p>My other hobby is to read books. I like making a summary of the book and record it in my note app. One of my favorite books is "A Marvelous Work and a Wonder" by <em>Richard Legrand</em>.</p>

    <h2>Frank Herbert</h2>
    <blockquote>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."</blockquote>
